title: Reducing Disparity and Increasing Diversity

event: 2019 SIOP Annual Conference
event_url: https://www.siop.org

location: Gaylord National Resort & Convention Center, Maryland

summary: A SIOP poster session analyzing  diversity hiring goals in law enforcement agencies.

abstract: 'We use simulated data in a law enforcement context to assess the degree to which our efforts to mitigate subgroup differences result in real world hiring of minority group members. We find that the effect size differences of selection tools are far less important than sample diversity and potential testing attendance rates.'
